# EwECaps
A repository that takes Ecopath with Ecosim with Ecospace output and calculates the ecosystem caps for the system under various types of calculations.

The repository has two R files: functions.R and caps_from_ewe.R. To run, open the R project ("Ecosystem Caps") and the caps_from_ewe.R file. This file will automatically source the functions.R file. There are 4 dependencies: dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, stringr.
